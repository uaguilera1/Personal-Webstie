  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p class=indent>
    Howdy! I am a 5th year senior in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University. I have always had a passion for technology and am currently enjoying learning about web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also enjoy the Electrical Engineering side of my degree because working with circuits and building Linux kernels have been difficult but fun tasks. I hope to land an internship for summer 2022, hopefully my skills shown on this website can showcase my skills.
  </p>
  <h2>Future goals and expectations.</h2>
  <p class=indent>
    I am excited to learn more about web development. I have a strong feeling that I can become a great web developer. This style of programming has proven to be more exciting and enjoyable, maybe because I am able to use my creativity and instantly see my results. There is also a large community of web developers which brings a great number of tools and tutorials to my disposal. I also am intrigued by hardware design and Linux development and I am excited to improve my skills in those areas as well to become a more well-rounded candidate.
  </p>
  <h2>More about myself.</h2>
  <p class=indent>
    I am the owner of a Dog, Luna, Cat, Mango, and a Bearded dragon named Lizzo. I enjoy watching and playing soccer as well as collecting retro video game consoles. I am a big anime fan and am currently watching/reading One Piece. I currently work IT and have been employed by Engineering IT since 2018. I have created documentation for the organization and routinely train the new student technicians. I really enjoy the customer service side of the job because it gives me a chance to interact with customers and the look of relief on their face when I fix their problem is fulfilling. Thank you for taking the time to visit my webpage, I hope you enjoy. You can find my contact information by clicking the Qualifications link above.
